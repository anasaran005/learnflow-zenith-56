course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_1,Source Documents,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlE-3sIrI_k ,"These are the original records where study data is first captured—like hospital charts, lab reports, or patient diaries. They serve as the backbone for trial data verification.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_2,What are Source Documents?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ878_QMaXc,"They’re the “proof” that the study data is real and reliable. If it wasn’t written, it wasn’t done. Regulators and monitors rely on these documents to confirm authenticity.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_3,Examples of Source Documents,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9rME1x_5DA,"Typical examples include medical records, hospital charts, laboratory test results, imaging reports, prescriptions, and even patient diaries. Anything that directly records subject data at the time of its creation counts as a source document.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_4,What is a CRF/eCRF?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-m3bhhrpR0 ,"A Case Report Form (CRF) is the structured document where trial data from source documents is transcribed. When used in digital format, it becomes an electronic CRF (eCRF), usually within an electronic data capture (EDC) system, making monitoring, auditing, and data cleaning much more efficient.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_5,Key Principles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuW_yNFJP2E ,"The integrity of documentation is built on the ALCOA+ principles: data must be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate, while also being complete, consistent, enduring, and available whenever required. These principles guide how clinical trial data is created and maintained.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_6,Real Role of CRC/CRA in Documentation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZoUF0ud0Qs ,"The Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) ensures that all trial data is accurately captured from source documents into the CRF, while also maintaining study files. The Clinical Research Associate (CRA), on the other hand, monitors the site, checks CRFs against source data, and ensures that Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards are consistently followed.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_7,Handling Corrections & Errors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMo6O1Sisek ,"Errors in documentation should never be erased or hidden. Instead, the correct approach is to draw a single line through the incorrect entry, record the correction nearby, and include initials, date, and reason if necessary. In an eCRF, the audit trail system automatically tracks changes, ensuring full transparency.",1
course_7,ch_7_01,les_7_01_01,topic_7_01_01_8,Common Mistakes to Avoid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LixrLMLmDVg ,"Frequent errors include late or backdated entries, missing investigator signatures, transcription mistakes when transferring data from source to CRF, and inconsistencies between different documents. These mistakes can compromise data integrity and delay regulatory approvals.",1
