Your supervisor, Ms. Rhea Patel, Quality Assurance Supervisor, needs you to ensure the lab’s Quality Management System (QMS) is on point. You’ve been tasked with checking if the lab’s batch record-keeping follows the QMS rules outlined in the SOP. Your job is to review the SOP, compare it to a lab observation, and fill out a Compliance Verification Form to confirm if the process is compliant or flag any issues. This keeps the lab’s operations safe and reliable, like a well-coordinated army following its playbook.

CheckList:
1. Review the SOP for batch record-keeping.
2. Compare it to a lab observation to check compliance.
3. Complete the Compliance Verification Form (100–150 words) to report your findings.

Why This Matters:
 Checking QMS compliance ensures every pill is safe and meets standards, protecting patients and avoiding costly mistakes.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0SDr6xPtfcQr_pH3YUCjAMVTI1it8zd/view?usp=sharing,https://tally.so/r/m6Bzeo,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFO3hiotOq3pHMEYGQtq--sIUvUq-OjA/view?usp=sharing,10,"Open SOP: Click “Reference Documents” → read Batch Record-Keeping Procedure (requires date, batch number, operator’s initials).
Review Observation: From Reference Documents → note issue: Some batch records missing operator’s initials.
Check Compliance: Compare SOP vs. observation → ask: Is the lab following the rule? What’s the gap?
Open Form: Click “Fillable Document” → Compliance Verification Form.
Complete Form:
Compliance Status: State if compliant or non-compliant.
Observation: Briefly describe the issue.
Recommendation: Suggest one practical fix (100–150 words).
Verify: Ensure findings are clear and solution is realistic.

You’re at Site 3, handling data for Patient ID# CN-0301, a 35-year-old woman, Ms. Priya Sharma. You have two source documents from her 2nd visit namely, a clinic vital signs record and a patient diary. Your job is to enter this data into the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) by the end of the day, following clinical trial rules.

You spot an error in the eCRF draft—the pulse rate is wrong (75 bpm instead of 70). A Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will check your work in three days to ensure data matches the sources. Fix the pulse error, log it, and make sure all data is accurate, complete, and follows ALCOA+ rules (Accurate, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Attributable). Avoid mistakes like unlogged changes or blank fields, which can cause audit issues.

Your Task: 
Use the source documents to fill the eCRF, correct the pulse rate, log the fix, and answer two questions about source documents, CRFs, and roles.

Deliverables
Submit these via the Tally.so form:
1. Completed eCRF (fill the template; mark fixes in **bold italics** in the Query/Notes column).
2. Correction Log (table listing the pulse error, fix, reason, and date—use the template below or a spreadsheet).
3. Short Answers (1-2 sentences each, typed in the form):

    - Name one common mistake in eCRF handling, one ALCOA+ principle you used, and how CRC/CRA roles prevent errors.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HkA3smTp7xLDEX5CFXHBizmVsCoG1tBd/view?usp=sharing ,https://tally.so/r/wvRGg4 ,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JitzOgdaOjRPGZnTzOxR3OmtrnRqjlw-/view?usp=sharing ,10,"Check Source Documents (5 minutes): Open the Reference Documents (Vital Signs Record and Patient Diary).
