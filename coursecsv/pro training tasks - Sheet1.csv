Your supervisor, Ms. Rhea Patel, Quality Assurance Supervisor, needs you to ensure the lab’s Quality Management System (QMS) is on point. You’ve been tasked with checking if the lab’s batch record-keeping follows the QMS rules outlined in the SOP. Your job is to review the SOP, compare it to a lab observation, and initiate filing using ZANE VERISURE to confirm if the process is compliant or flag any issues. This keeps the lab’s operations safe and reliable, like a well-coordinated army following its playbook.

Task Details:
1. Review the SOP for batch record-keeping.
2. Compare it to a lab observation to check compliance.
3. Document your assessment using ZANE VERISURE to report your findings.

Why This Matters: Checking QMS compliance ensures every pill is safe and meets standards, protecting patients and avoiding costly mistakes.

Read the lab observation in the Reference Documents: “Some batch records are missing the operator’s initials.”
Check for compliance: Compare the SOP (what should happen) to the observation (what’s happening). Ask: Does the lab follow the QMS rule? What’s the issue?

We'll target adults aged 18-65 with moderate asthma, who've been diagnosed for at least one year and have no recent hospitalizations. The intervention involves participants taking a 10 mg AstmaClear tablet daily for 12 weeks, or a matching placebo. Key stakeholders include ClearPharma as the sponsor, our Apex CRO team, the site investigators, and of course, the enrolled patients. We're expecting outcomes like reduced asthma symptoms (think less wheezing and shortness of breath) and decreased reliance on rescue inhalers, all with minimal side effects such as mild nausea.
