Your supervisor, Ms. Rhea Patel, Quality Assurance Supervisor, needs you to ensure the lab’s Quality Management System (QMS) is on point. You’ve been tasked with checking if the lab’s batch record-keeping follows the QMS rules outlined in the SOP. Your job is to review the SOP, compare it to a lab observation, and fill out a Compliance Verification Form to confirm if the process is compliant or flag any issues. This keeps the lab’s operations safe and reliable, like a well-coordinated army following its playbook.

CheckList:
1. Review the SOP for batch record-keeping.
2. Compare it to a lab observation to check compliance.
3. Complete the Compliance Verification Form (100–150 words) to report your findings.

Why This Matters:
 Checking QMS compliance ensures every pill is safe and meets standards, protecting patients and avoiding costly mistakes.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0SDr6xPtfcQr_pH3YUCjAMVTI1it8zd/view?usp=sharing,https://tally.so/r/m6Bzeo,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFO3hiotOq3pHMEYGQtq--sIUvUq-OjA/view?usp=sharing,"Open SOP: Click “Reference Documents” → read Batch Record-Keeping Procedure (requires date, batch number, operator’s initials).
Review Observation: From Reference Documents → note issue: Some batch records missing operator’s initials.
Check Compliance: Compare SOP vs. observation → ask: Is the lab following the rule? What’s the gap?
Open Form: Click “Fillable Document” → Compliance Verification Form.
Complete Form:
Compliance Status: State if compliant or non-compliant.
Observation: Briefly describe the issue.
Recommendation: Suggest one practical fix (100–150 words).
Verify: Ensure findings are clear and solution is realistic.
