Your supervisor, Ms. Rhea Patel, Quality Assurance Supervisor, needs you to ensure the lab’s Quality Management System (QMS) is on point. You’ve been tasked with checking if the lab’s batch record-keeping follows the QMS rules outlined in the SOP. Your job is to review the SOP, compare it to a lab observation, and initiate filing using ZANE VERISURE to confirm if the process is compliant or flag any issues. This keeps the lab’s operations safe and reliable, like a well-coordinated army following its playbook.

Task Details:
1. Review the SOP for batch record-keeping.
2. Compare it to a lab observation to check compliance.
3. Document your assessment using ZANE VERISURE to report your findings.

Why This Matters: Checking QMS compliance ensures every pill is safe and meets standards, protecting patients and avoiding costly mistakes.

During a routine hardness test for tablet batch TAB-2025-055, the result is 3.5 kg, below the SOP-QC-008 specification of 4–6 kg (deviation detected). 

Initial assessment shows major impact on product quality, and RCA reveals a machine malfunction due to overdue maintenance. Ms. Patel instructs you to simulate the full Deviation to CAPA lifecycle using two tools: 

1. DeviTrack for detection, logging, assessment, containment, and RCA.
2. CAPA Commander for drafting corrective/preventive actions, implementation, verification, and closure.

Key stakeholders include ClearPharma as the sponsor, our Apex CRO team, the site investigators, and of course, the enrolled patients.
